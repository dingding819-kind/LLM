【題目】
（）1、Choose the correct form of the verb: If I _____ you were coming, I would have prepared dinner.
(A) know
(B) knew
(C) had known
(D) would know

【答案】
（C）1、This is a mixed conditional sentence (third conditional structure).
The sentence structure requires past perfect in the if-clause: "If I had known..."
Analysis of options:
(A) know - simple present, incorrect tense
(B) knew - simple past, not specific enough
(C) ✓ had known - past perfect, correct for this conditional
(D) would know - future/present, doesn't fit the context

========================================
【範圍】Tense / Present Perfect
【題目】
（）2、Which sentence uses the present perfect tense correctly?
(A) I have been to Paris last year
(B) She has finished her homework two hours ago
(C) They have lived in this house for ten years
(D) He has just went to the store

【答案】
（C）2、Present perfect tense analysis:
The present perfect (have/has + past participle) is used for:
- Experiences with no specific time: "I have been to Paris"
- Ongoing situations: "They have lived here for ten years" ✓
- Recent actions: "He has just gone to the store"

(A) Incorrect - "last year" indicates past, use simple past
(B) Incorrect - "two hours ago" requires simple past
(C) ✓ Correct - "for ten years" shows duration, needs present perfect
(D) Incorrect - Wrong past participle (should be "gone")

========================================
【範圍】Vocabulary / Phrasal Verbs
【題目】
（）3、Select the correct phrasal verb: The project was _____ because of lack of funding.
(A) called off
(B) called on
(C) called out
(D) called up

【答案】
（A）3、Phrasal verb meanings:
- call off = cancel
- call on = request/visit
- call out = shout/expose
- call up = telephone/mobilize

(A) ✓ called off - means "cancelled due to lack of funding"
(B) called on - would mean "requested to participate"
(C) called out - would mean "shouted about" 
(D) called up - would mean "telephoned"

The sentence requires "cancelled", so "called off" is correct.
